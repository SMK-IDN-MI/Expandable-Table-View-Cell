# Expandable-Table-View-Cell
Create TableView within Table View by playing the section role.

This project refers to the video by Jared Davidson. Check it out [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClrSpJ3txAs).

_Little Description_: I think this is one of the best practice to create table view inside the table view (sub-table-view). I created table view inside table view before and found out that the layout is somehow bugged, the layout ain't show as expected unless I scroll it down. After get scrolled the view will be refreshed and it show as expected. I put the `layoutIfNeeded()` but it still not working.
